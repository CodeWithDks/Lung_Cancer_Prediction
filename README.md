🏥 Lung Cancer Prediction

📌 Project Overview

The Lung Cancer Prediction Web App is a machine learning-powered application designed to assist in the early detection of lung cancer. By analyzing patient data, the model predicts the likelihood of lung cancer, enabling early intervention and improved medical outcomes.
